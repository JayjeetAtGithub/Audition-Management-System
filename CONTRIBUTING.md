# How to contribute

Thanks for taking your time to help the project.

This should be as easy as possible for you but there are a few things
to consider when contributing.  The following guidelines for
contribution should be followed if you want to submit a pull request.

## How to prepare

* You need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Submit an [issue ticket](https://github.com/JayjeetAtGithub/Audition-Management-System/issues) here,
  for your issue if there is no one yet.
  * Describe the issue, if it's a Bug or Feature/Improvement.
  * If it's bug provide details steps to reproduce it.
* If you want to work on fixing the issue, fork the repository on GitHub.

## Make Changes

* In your forked repository, create a topic branch for your upcoming
  patch. (e.g. `feature/new-panel` or `bug/no-logs`)
  * Usually this is based on the `master` branch.
  * Create a branch based on master `git branch bug/no-logs master`
      then checkout the new branch with `git checkout bug/no-logs`.
      Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units and describe them properly.
* Assure nothing is broken by running the application and chacking it's all features.

## Submit Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Open a pull request to the original repository and choose the right
  original branch you want to patch.
* If not done in commit messages (which you really should do) please
  reference and update your issue with the code changes. But _please
  DO NOT close the issue yourself_.
* Even if you have write access to the repository, do not directly
  push or merge pull-requests. Let another team member review your
  pull request and approve.
